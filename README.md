# Wormhole-Geodesic
Implementation of Newton-Raphson method to calculate geodesics on a wormhole.
Also contains implementation of Gaussian elimination with pivot for matrices that are almost diagonal,
and a functional iteration method for geodesics.
For more information on the methods used, see https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jbaek/18.821.paper2.pdf.
For more information on wormholes, see https://www.spacetimetravel.org/wurmlochflug/wurmlochflug.html.
Unfortunately, it seems like Newton-Raphson tends to diverge on this surface.
